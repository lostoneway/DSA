# Multiple Pointers 
- Creating pointers (just a variable) or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. 

- Some sort of linear structure (array or string). We are searching for a pair of values that meets a condition. 

## Example: 
Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of itegers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
