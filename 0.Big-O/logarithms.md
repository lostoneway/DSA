# Logarithms 
- More complex mathematical expressions 
- A logarithm is the inversion of exponenation (exponents!)


log<sub>2</sub>(8)= 3  ->  2<sup>3</sup> = 8

log<sub>2</sub>(value) = exponent -> 2<sup>exponent</sup> = value

## Let's simplify it at scale since it doesn't really matter:
 log<sub>2</sup>! So log === log<sup>2</sup>

## Why do we care?
- Certain searching algos have log time complexity
- Efficient sorting algos involve logs 
- Recursion sometimes involves log space compleity
