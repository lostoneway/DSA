This will serve as my place for my Data Structures and Algorithms study guide and notes. I will be using Colt Steele's DSA Masterclass and Scotch.io The Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Algorithms courses. 

## Remember! 
Data structures help us organize data meaningfully and algorithms manipulate data for us efficiently. 

## Tech used: 
- JavaScript
